# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is currently an empty repository initialized with git. The repository appears to be named "ffxi" suggesting it may be related to Final Fantasy XI development.

## Getting Started

Since this is a fresh repository, you'll need to:

1. Determine the project type and technology stack based on user requirements
2. Initialize the appropriate project structure (e.g., `npm init`, `cargo init`, `go mod init`, etc.)
3. Set up build tools, linting, and testing frameworks as appropriate for the chosen technology

## Development Workflow

Once the project structure is established, common commands should be documented here including:

- Build commands
- Test execution
- Linting and formatting
- Development server startup

## Architecture Notes

Architecture documentation will be added as the codebase develops and patterns emerge.

## Important Reminders

- This repository starts empty, so always confirm technology choices with the user before initializing project structure
- Follow established patterns once they're created in the codebase
- Document build and test commands in this file as they're established
